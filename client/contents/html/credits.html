        Classic snake is a tiny little project by javascript enthusiast and all round badass 
        <strong> atifcppprogrammer</strong>. He is an up and coming web developer attempting 
        to master the <strong>MERN</strong> stack. When he is not coding he can be found 
        reading up on geopolitics, fiddling around with arduino kits and just chilling in 
        general. You can find the code for this project and many others on his 
        <a href = "/https://github.com/atifcppprogrammer"><strong>Github</strong></a>
        page.
